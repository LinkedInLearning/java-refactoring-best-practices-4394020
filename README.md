Being able to write Java is great, but it’s also vitally important to write code in a way that is maintainable—and future-proof. In this course, Maaike van Putten teaches you how to organize and reorganize code in a way that is easy to maintain, sharing best practices and techniques for refactoring Java code in order to improve its quality, maintainability, and performance. Maaike begins with an introduction to refactoring and technical debt, and covers tools and techniques for refactoring in Java. She then moves on to best practices for writing clean and maintainable code, including naming conventions, style guidelines, and tips for using whitespace and comments effectively. Join Maaike in this course to learn how to refactor existing code to clean it up and make it easier—and cheaper—to maintain.
