// handles the checkout process, including calculating the total
// amount, applying discounts, and processing the payment.
// The method has grown too large and contains too much functionality.
// Refactor the method to make it more concise and easier to maintain.
// The actual implementation is left out for simplicity.
// The solution can also just contain comments in the extracted methods.
